# LogFM The LogFileManager
A tool to manage logfiles, recorded by the SD Logging special function
on an [EdgeTX](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx) B&W or color radio.

The script has been tested on the following radios:
- Radiomaster Zorro

## Features and Operation
The start screen shows a tree view (root, Model and logfiles) of the logfiles found on the SD card in the LOGS directory.
Navigation through the tree elements with the Rotary Wheel.
Short pressing ```Enter``` on a selected node checks/unchecks all files under that node.
A long press of ```Enter```leads to a confirmation page to delete the checked logfiles.

During deletion, the progress is displayed and after all checked files were deleted, you are presented a report
of the number of files deleted and the saved space on the SD card.
