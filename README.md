## Features and Operation
The start screen shows a tree view (root, Model and logfiles) of the logfiles found on the SD card in the LOGS directory.
Navigation through the tree elements with the Rotary Wheel.
<br/>
Short pressing ```Enter``` on a selected node checks/unchecks all files under that node.
<br/>
Check/unckeck all logfiles for a model by pressing ```Enter``` on a Model node.
<br/>
All logfiles on the SD card can be checked/unckecked by pressing ```Enter``` on the root node.
<br/>
A long press of ```Enter``` leads to a confirmation page to delete the checked logfiles.

During deletion, the progress is displayed.
<br/>
After all checked files were deleted, you are presented a report
of the number of files deleted and the saved space on the SD card.
